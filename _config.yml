          editing password, and viewing profile details amongst others.

          Travel Recommendations web app | April 2024 | 2-week project
          Tech:  Python | Flask | React  | HTML | CSS | Render (deployment)
          
          Personalised travel recommendations based on user preferences and historical weather data. Multiple APIs fetch 
          relevant data, tailoring recommendations to user input, including city details and weather APIs. A map API allows 
          visual exploration of recommended cities. Logic and API request timing was refactored to reduce response time 
          leading to a seamless User Experience.
